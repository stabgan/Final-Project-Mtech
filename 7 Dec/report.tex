\section{Project Summary}
Manual annotation of \textbf{International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes} from clinical narratives is time-consuming and error-prone, hindering efficient billing, research, and clinical decision support. This project targets accurate ICD code prediction, emphasizing improvement on \textbf{rare codes} that are often underrepresented in training data.

Building upon the need for robust, clinically meaningful models, the approach starts with establishing strong baseline models (e.g., transformer-based architectures trained on MIMIC-IV) to measure initial performance. Subsequently, a \textbf{hybrid data augmentation strategy} that integrates \textbf{Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)} and ontology-driven synthetic note generation will be employed. RAG retrieves comprehensive code-related contexts from sources such as \textbf{PubMed}, \textbf{Wikipedia}, and \textbf{WHO API}, enriching code descriptions with domain knowledge. Ontology-based methods ensure the generated synthetic clinical notes for rare codes incorporate medically accurate entities (from SNOMED CT, RxNorm), aligning closely with real-world scenarios.

This hybrid augmentation aims to enhance data diversity, improve model performance on rare codes, and maintain domain specificity. Advanced classification strategies (e.g., label embedding, hierarchical classification, label grouping) will handle the large, sparse label space. Explainability techniques (SHAP, LIME, Integrated Gradients) will be integrated after performance baselines are established, ensuring clinicians can trust and understand model decisions.

The end goal is an \textbf{open-source toolkit} that supports automated, interpretable ICD coding, facilitating more reliable healthcare operations and informed clinical research. This approach acknowledges possible setbacksâ€”if RAG or synthetic data yield limited improvement, simpler balancing methods or curriculum learning may be revisited. Agile iteration and continuous feedback loops (including potential human-in-the-loop validation) ensure a flexible, first-principles-driven methodology.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Develop a transformer-based model}: Begin with baseline transformer architectures (e.g., ClinicalBERT) to encode clinical text and measure initial performance, then extend to enriched ICD code embeddings.
    \item \textbf{Implement hybrid data augmentation}: Use RAG plus ontology-based synthetic note generation to improve representation of rare ICD codes.
    \item \textbf{Leverage knowledge graphs and ontologies}: Integrate SNOMED CT, RxNorm, and ICD-10-CM mappings to provide domain context and semantic structure.
    \item \textbf{Enhance multi-label classification}: Employ label embedding, hierarchical classification, and label grouping to handle extensive ICD vocabularies efficiently.
    \item \textbf{Integrate explainability techniques}: Incorporate SHAP, LIME, and Integrated Gradients to elucidate model decisions, improving clinician trust.
    \item \textbf{Boost evaluation metrics}: Achieve at least a 10\% increase in macro F2-score on rare ICD codes compared to baseline models.
    \item \textbf{Open-source delivery}: Produce a toolkit for automated, explainable ICD coding usable by the research community and healthcare industry.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Current State of the Art}
Accurate ICD coding from clinical text is critical for healthcare efficiency. Transformer-based models (BERT, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, Longformer) have improved performance by capturing contextual nuances in clinical narratives \cite{si2019enhancing, sheu2022survey}. Nonetheless, \textbf{rare ICD codes} challenge these models due to data imbalance and scarcity.

Data augmentation strategies have emerged: Wang et al. \cite{wang2019clinical} employed GANs to generate synthetic clinical notes, improving performance on rare codes. \textbf{Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)} shows promise by combining retrieval and generation to provide contextually relevant synthetic data.

Knowledge graphs (e.g., SNOMED CT, RxNorm) offer structured domain knowledge \cite{gong2023explainable}, aiding models in understanding medical concepts and relationships. Integrating these with transformer-based models can boost accuracy and interpretability.

\textbf{Explainable AI (XAI)} is crucial in clinical settings. Techniques like SHAP, LIME, and Integrated Gradients provide interpretable insights \cite{fantozzi2024explainability, volkov2024local, szczepanski2021new, gucukbel2023evaluating}, enhancing model transparency. Human-in-the-loop strategies allow clinicians to guide model refinement, aligning AI-driven coding with practical clinical workflows \cite{panda2023clinician}.

Gaps remain in seamlessly combining RAG-based augmentation, knowledge graphs, and XAI for rare ICD code prediction. Existing entity recognition tools (cTAKES, MedSpaCy, MedCat) are not fully integrated with hybrid augmentation frameworks. This project bridges these gaps by unifying these approaches into a coherent methodology.

\section{Methodology}
This methodology integrates baseline development, advanced augmentation, knowledge integration, and explainability in a stepwise manner:

\textbf{Data Representation}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extract and normalize clinical text, map entities to SNOMED CT and RxNorm for semantic richness.
    \item Use RAG to augment ICD code descriptions with detailed clinical, epidemiological, and treatment information from external sources.
    \item Represent both clinical notes and code descriptions as transformer-based embeddings for semantic alignment.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Model Architecture}:
