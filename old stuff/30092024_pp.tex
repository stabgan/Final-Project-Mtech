\section{Introduction}

The accurate prediction of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes from clinical text is a critical task in healthcare informatics. This project aims to develop a robust system capable of handling multi-label, multi-class classification for ICD codes, with a special focus on rare codes that suffer from limited data availability. The strategy involves generating synthetic clinical notes using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Medical Knowledge Graphs (MKGs), leveraging resources such as UMLS, SNOMED CT, RxNorm, MIMIC-IV, and pre-built knowledge graphs like PrimeKG and the Clinical Knowledge Graph (CKG). The plan incorporates advanced techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and utilizes state-of-the-art tools and libraries such as LangChain, Neo4j, and PyKEEN.

\section{High-Level Plan}

The project will be executed in several phases, each building upon the previous to achieve the final goal of an accurate and explainable ICD-10-CM code prediction system. The high-level plan includes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Preparation and Knowledge Graph Integration}
    \item \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Synthetic Clinical Note Generation}
    \item \textbf{Model Development and Fine-Tuning with Enhanced Data}
    \item \textbf{Evaluation and Validation Using LLM-Assisted Quality Assessment}
    \item \textbf{Deployment, Integration, and Continuous Improvement}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Detailed Steps and Strategy}

\subsection{Phase 1: Data Preparation and Knowledge Graph Integration}

\subsubsection{Step 1: Selection and Acquisition of Pre-built Knowledge Graphs}

Utilize existing high-quality medical knowledge graphs to avoid the time-consuming process of building one from scratch. Recommended KGs include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PrimeKG}: A multimodal knowledge graph for precision medicine analyses, integrating over 20 resources and covering diseases, drugs, symptoms, and more.
    \item \textbf{Clinical Knowledge Graph (CKG)}: Integrates experimental data and public databases, offering comprehensive clinical and biomedical knowledge.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 2: Integration of Knowledge Graphs with Existing Data}

Combine the selected KGs with existing datasets:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{UMLS Metathesaurus}
    \item \textbf{SNOMED CT}
    \item \textbf{RxNorm}
    \item \textbf{SNOMED CT to ICD-10-CM Mapping Data}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Data Integration}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Map entities across different KGs using unique identifiers (e.g., UMLS CUIs).
    \item Align concepts from various ontologies to create a unified knowledge base.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Mathematical Representation}

Let the integrated knowledge graph be represented as:

\begin{equation}
G_{\text{total}} = G_{\text{PrimeKG}} \cup G_{\text{CKG}} \cup G_{\text{UMLS}} \cup G_{\text{SNOMED}} \cup G_{\text{RxNorm}}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Step 3: Data Cleaning and Normalization}

Ensure consistency across the integrated knowledge base:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Normalization Techniques}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Standardize terminology using UMLS.
        \item Resolve duplicates and inconsistencies.
        \item Harmonize data formats and units.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 4: Understanding ICD-10-CM Code Hierarchies}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyze the hierarchical structure of ICD-10-CM codes.
    \item Create a hierarchical tree or ontology to visualize parent-child relationships.
    \item Recognize that ICD codes have four hierarchies: Category, Subcategory, Etiology/Anatomy/Severity, and Extension.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 2: Retrieval-Augmented Synthetic Clinical Note Generation}

\subsubsection{Step 1: Strategy for ICD Code Combination Selection}

\paragraph{Leveraging Knowledge Graphs to Find Associated ICD Codes}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use KGs to identify diseases that frequently co-occur (e.g., diabetes and hypercholesterolemia).
    \item Extract relationships such as "comorbid\_with," "associated\_with," "risk\_factor\_for," and "complication\_of."
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Mathematical Representation}

For any two diseases \( d_i \) and \( d_j \):

\begin{equation}
e_{ij} \in E \text{ if there exists a relationship between } d_i \text{ and } d_j
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Mapping Diseases to ICD-10-CM Codes}

Define a mapping function:

\begin{equation}
f: V \rightarrow C
\end{equation}

where \( V \) is the set of medical concepts in the KG, and \( C \) is the set of ICD-10-CM codes.

\subsubsection{Step 2: Generating Co-Occurrence Matrices and Clustering}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a co-occurrence matrix \( M \) where \( M_{ij} \) represents the strength of association between ICD codes \( c_i \) and \( c_j \).
    \item Use statistical data from MIMIC-IV to calculate co-occurrence frequencies.
    \item Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., hierarchical clustering) to group ICD codes into clusters of related conditions.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Mathematical Representation}

Let \( \mathcal{C} = \{C_1, C_2, ..., C_k\} \) be the set of clusters, where each cluster \( C_k \) contains closely related ICD codes.

\subsubsection{Step 3: Developing a Probabilistic Model for Code Selection}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculate the probability \( P(C_i | C_j) \) of code \( C_i \) occurring with code \( C_j \).
    \item For a set of codes \( \{C_1, C_2, ..., C_n\} \), compute the joint probability \( P(C_1, C_2, ..., C_n) \).
    \item Use association rule mining (e.g., Apriori algorithm) to find frequent itemsets of ICD codes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 4: Implementing Constraints for Clinical Plausibility}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Define exclusion rules to prevent incompatible code combinations (e.g., male-specific and female-specific conditions).
    \item Ensure mandatory inclusions where necessary (e.g., underlying conditions when complications are present).
    \item Incorporate patient demographics and risk factors into code selection.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 5: Weighted Random Sampling for Code Combination Selection}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use weighted random sampling based on the probabilities from the probabilistic model.
    \item Introduce randomness to ensure diversity while maintaining clinical plausibility.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 6: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline Setup}

\paragraph{Process}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Input}: Selected ICD-10-CM code combinations and their descriptions.
    \item \textbf{Retrieval Module}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Query the integrated KG to fetch related information:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Symptoms
            \item Medications
            \item Procedures
            \item Patient demographics
            \item Associated conditions
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Structured Output}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Organize retrieved information into structured formats (e.g., JSON, XML, Markdown).
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Mathematical Representation}

For an ICD code set \( C = \{c_1, c_2, ..., c_n\} \):

\begin{equation}
N_C, E_C = \text{Retrieve}(G_{\text{total}}, C)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Step 7: Prompt Engineering with Retrieved Knowledge}

\paragraph{Example Prompt}

\textit{Generate a clinical note for a \textbf{[age]}-year-old \textbf{[gender]} patient diagnosed with \textbf{[Disease Names]} (ICD-10-CM codes: \textbf{[Codes]}). The patient presents with the following symptoms: \textbf{[Symptom List]}. Medical history includes: \textbf{[Medical History]}. Physical examination findings: \textbf{[Examination Findings]}. Laboratory results: \textbf{[Lab Results]}. The assessment includes: \textbf{[List of ICD codes]}. Plan includes: \textbf{[Treatments and Procedures]}.}

\subsubsection{Step 8: Large Language Model Utilization}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Choose an appropriate LLM for text generation:

        \item \textbf{Fine-Tuned Model}: Fine-tune models like T5 or LLaMA on medical text data.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Fine-Tuning Process}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use MIMIC-IV clinical notes for fine-tuning, focusing on style and terminology.
    \item Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 9: Synthetic Clinical Note Generation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Input the prompt into the LLM.
    \item Generate the clinical note, ensuring medical accuracy and plausibility.
    \item Ensure that all selected ICD codes are appropriately represented in the text.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 10: Quality Assessment Using an Auxiliary LLM}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Employ another LLM to assess the quality of the generated clinical notes.

        \item Language quality
        \item Consistency with provided information
    \end{itemize}
    \item Compare with real data from MIMIC-IV using similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE scores).

\section{Technical Concepts and Mathematical Details}

\subsection{Integration of LLMs and Knowledge Graphs}

\paragraph{Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)}

Combines LLMs with external knowledge sources during inference:

\begin{equation}
P(T|Q) = \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}} P(T|Q, z) P(z|Q)
\end{equation}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( T \) is the generated text.
    \item \( Q \) is the query or prompt.
    \item \( z \) is the retrieved knowledge.
    \item \( \mathcal{Z} \) is the set of all possible retrieved documents.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Knowledge Integration}

\paragraph{Graph Attention Networks (GATs)}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_i' = \sigma\left( \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \alpha_{ij} \mathbf{W} \mathbf{h}_j \right)
\end{equation}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \alpha_{ij} \) is the attention coefficient between nodes \( i \) and \( j \).
    \item \( \mathbf{W} \) is the weight matrix.
    \item \( \sigma \) is an activation function.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{LLM-Assisted Quality Evaluation}

\paragraph{BERTScore}

Uses pre-trained LLM embeddings to evaluate similarity:

    \item \( P \) is the set of predicted tokens.
    \item \( R \) is the set of reference tokens.
    \item \( e_x \) and \( e_y \) are embeddings of tokens \( x \) and \( y \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mathematical Modeling of Code Selection}

\paragraph{Probabilistic Model}

For code combinations:

\begin{equation}
P(C_1, C_2, ..., C_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(C_i | C_{i-1}, ..., C_1)
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Association Rule Mining}

Identify frequent itemsets \( I \) where support and confidence meet thresholds:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Support}: \( \text{support}(I) = \frac{\text{Frequency of } I}{\text{Total Transactions}} \)
    \item \textbf{Confidence}: \( \text{confidence}(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{\text{support}(A \cup B)}{\text{support}(A)} \)
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

By systematically following the detailed plan outlined above, the project aims to develop a robust and accurate ICD-10-CM code prediction system. The integration of synthetic clinical note generation, knowledge graph utilization, advanced modeling techniques, and rigorous evaluation will address the challenges associated with multi-label, multi-class classification in the medical domain.
