\section{Introduction}

The accurate prediction of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes from clinical text is a critical task in healthcare informatics. This project aims to develop a robust system that can handle multi-label, multi-class classification for ICD codes, especially focusing on rare codes with limited data availability. The strategy involves generating synthetic clinical notes using large language models (LLMs) integrated with medical knowledge graphs (MKGs), leveraging resources such as UMLS, SNOMED CT, RxNorm, and MIMIC-IV.

\section{High-Level Plan}

The project will be executed in several phases, each building upon the previous to achieve the final goal of an accurate and explainable ICD-10-CM code prediction system. The high-level plan includes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Preparation and Knowledge Graph Construction}
    \item \textbf{Synthetic Clinical Note Generation}
    \item \textbf{Model Development and Fine-Tuning}
    \item \textbf{Evaluation and Validation}
    \item \textbf{Deployment and Integration}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Detailed Steps and Strategy}

\subsection{Phase 1: Data Preparation and Knowledge Graph Construction}

\subsubsection{Step 1: Data Acquisition}

Collect and organize all necessary datasets and resources:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)}: Provides a comprehensive set of biomedical terms and concepts.
    \item \textbf{SNOMED CT}: Offers detailed clinical terminology.
    \item \textbf{RxNorm}: Contains normalized names for clinical drugs.
    \item \textbf{MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-IV Notes}: Real clinical data for reference.
    \item \textbf{ICD-10-CM Code Descriptions}: Official code definitions and descriptions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 2: Medical Knowledge Graph (MKG) Construction}

Build an MKG that integrates information from the above resources.

\paragraph{Nodes and Edges}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nodes}: Diseases (ICD-10-CM codes), symptoms, medications, procedures, patient demographics.
    \item \textbf{Edges}: Relationships such as "has\_symptom", "treated\_with", "associated\_with", "common\_in\_age\_group".
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Mathematical Representation}

The MKG can be represented as a graph \( G = (V, E) \), where \( V \) is the set of nodes and \( E \) is the set of edges. Each edge \( e_{ij} \in E \) represents a relationship between nodes \( v_i \) and \( v_j \).

\paragraph{Data Integration}

Use mapping techniques to align concepts from different ontologies:

\begin{equation}
\text{Map}(C_{\text{SNOMED}}, C_{\text{ICD-10-CM}}): C_{\text{SNOMED}} \rightarrow C_{\text{ICD-10-CM}}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Step 3: Data Cleaning and Normalization}

Ensure consistency in terminology and data formats across all datasets.

\paragraph{Normalization Techniques}

Apply methods such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Term Normalization}: Convert synonyms to a standard term using UMLS.
    \item \textbf{Concept Mapping}: Align different coding systems via UMLS CUIs (Concept Unique Identifiers).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 2: Synthetic Clinical Note Generation}

\subsubsection{Step 1: Template Development}

Create standardized templates for clinical notes that include sections like:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Chief Complaint
    \item History of Present Illness (HPI)
    \item Past Medical History
    \item Physical Examination
    \item Laboratory and Imaging Results
    \item Assessment and Plan
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 2: Prompt Engineering}

Develop prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) that incorporate:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Disease information (ICD-10-CM code and description)
    \item Associated symptoms sampled from the MKG
    \item Patient demographics (age, gender)
    \item Style examples from real clinical notes
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example Prompt}

\textit{Generate a clinical note for a patient diagnosed with \textbf{[Disease Name]} (ICD-10-CM code: \textbf{[Code]}). The patient presents with the following symptoms: \textbf{[Symptom 1]}, \textbf{[Symptom 2]}, \textbf{[Symptom 3]}. Include relevant medical history, physical examination findings, and a plan for management.}

\subsubsection{Step 3: Symptom Sampling}

Randomly select 1 to 5 symptoms for each disease from the MKG, ensuring medical plausibility.

\paragraph{Mathematical Model}

Assuming the set of symptoms for a disease \( D \) is \( S_D \), we sample a subset \( S_D' \subseteq S_D \) where \( |S_D'| \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \).

\subsubsection{Step 4: Synthetic Note Generation Using LLMs}

\paragraph{Model Selection}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GPT-4}: Use as a baseline for high-quality generation.
    \item \textbf{Fine-Tuned Models}: Fine-tune models like LLaMA using an instruction-following dataset.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Fine-Tuning Process}

Train the model to follow medical instructions and generate clinically accurate text.

\subsubsection{Step 5: Data Augmentation}

Generate multiple synthetic notes per ICD-10-CM code to enrich the dataset, especially for rare codes.

\subsection{Phase 3: Model Development and Fine-Tuning}

\subsubsection{Step 1: Embedding Generation}

Create embeddings for both clinical notes and ICD code descriptions.

\paragraph{Mathematical Representation}

Given a text \( t \), its embedding \( \mathbf{e} \) is generated using a function \( f \):

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{e} = f(t)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Step 2: Multi-Label Classification Model}

Develop a model that maps clinical note embeddings to ICD code embeddings.

\paragraph{Loss Function}

Use a binary cross-entropy loss for multi-label classification:

\begin{equation}
L = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i) \right]
\end{equation}

where \( y_i \) is the ground truth label and \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted probability.

\subsubsection{Step 3: Handling Class Imbalance}

Apply techniques such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Focal Loss}: To focus on hard-to-classify examples.

    \begin{equation}
    L_{\text{focal}} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ \alpha (1 - \hat{y}_i)^\gamma y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - \alpha) \hat{y}_i^\gamma (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i) \right]
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Oversampling of Rare Classes}
    \item \textbf{Label Grouping and Hierarchical Classification}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 4: Knowledge Graph Integration}

Incorporate knowledge graph embeddings into the model to capture relationships between medical concepts.

\paragraph{Graph Embedding Techniques}

Use methods like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to generate embeddings \( \mathbf{h}_v \) for each node \( v \) in the MKG.

\subsubsection{Step 5: Model Training}

Train the model using the augmented dataset, ensuring convergence and preventing overfitting.

\paragraph{Optimization Algorithm}

Use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimizer for training.

\subsection{Phase 4: Evaluation and Validation}

\subsubsection{Step 1: Evaluation Metrics}

Use appropriate metrics for multi-label, multi-class classification:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Precision, Recall, F1-score
    \item Macro and Micro Averaging
    \item Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)
    \item F\textsubscript{2}-score (emphasizing recall)

    \begin{equation}
    F_2 = (1 + 2^2) \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{(2^2 \times \text{Precision}) + \text{Recall}}
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 2: Model Validation}

Perform cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

\subsubsection{Step 3: Error Analysis}

Analyze misclassifications to identify patterns and areas for improvement.

\subsection{Phase 5: Deployment and Integration}

\subsubsection{Step 1: Explainability Integration}

Use techniques like SHAP, LIME, and Integrated Gradients to provide explanations for model predictions.

\subsubsection{Step 2: Human-in-the-Loop Integration}

Develop interfaces for clinicians to review and provide feedback on model predictions, improving trust and reliability.

\subsubsection{Step 3: Toolkit Development}

Create an open-source toolkit that automates the ICD coding process and facilitates adoption.

\section{Technical Concepts and Mathematical Details}

\subsection{Large Language Models (LLMs) and Fine-Tuning}

\paragraph{Transformer Architecture}

LLMs like GPT-4 and LLaMA are based on the transformer architecture, which uses self-attention mechanisms.

\paragraph{Self-Attention Mechanism}

For a sequence of input embeddings \( X = [x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n] \), the self-attention is computed as:

\begin{equation}
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right)V
\end{equation}

where \( Q \), \( K \), and \( V \) are the query, key, and value matrices derived from \( X \), and \( d_k \) is the dimension of the keys.

\subsection{Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)}

\paragraph{Graph Convolutional Networks}

GCNs update node embeddings based on their neighbors:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_v^{(k)} = \sigma \left( \sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} \frac{1}{c_{vu}} \mathbf{W} \mathbf{h}_u^{(k-1)} \right)
\end{equation}

where \( \mathbf{h}_v^{(k)} \) is the embedding of node \( v \) at layer \( k \), \( \mathcal{N}(v) \) is the set of neighbors, \( c_{vu} \) is a normalization constant, \( \mathbf{W} \) is a weight matrix, and \( \sigma \) is an activation function.

\subsection{Multi-Label Classification Metrics}

\paragraph{Micro and Macro Averaging}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Micro-Averaging}: Aggregates contributions of all classes to compute average metric.
    \item \textbf{Macro-Averaging}: Computes metric independently for each class and then takes the average.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Hamming Loss}

Measures the fraction of labels that are incorrectly predicted:

\begin{equation}
\text{Hamming Loss} = \frac{1}{N \times L} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{L} \mathbb{I}[y_{ij} \neq \hat{y}_{ij}]
\end{equation}

where \( N \) is the number of samples, \( L \) is the number of labels, \( y_{ij} \) is the ground truth, \( \hat{y}_{ij} \) is the prediction, and \( \mathbb{I} \) is the indicator function.

\section{Conclusion}

By systematically following the detailed plan outlined above, the project aims to develop a robust and accurate ICD-10-CM code prediction system. The integration of synthetic clinical note generation, knowledge graph construction, advanced modeling techniques, and rigorous evaluation will address the challenges associated with multi-label, multi-class classification in the medical domain.
