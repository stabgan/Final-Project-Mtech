    This work is dedicated to the incredible community of teachers, mentors, and classmates who \\
    helped shape my understanding and curiosity. Your wisdom, shared enthusiasm, \\
    and kind guidance have propelled me through every challenge.\\[1.0em]
    Special thanks to my professors, who brought complex ideas to life, \\
    and to my mentors, whose faith in my potential and real-world insights \\
    enriched my knowledge in ways a classroom alone could never provide.\\[1.0em]
    To all of you, I am deeply grateful.
